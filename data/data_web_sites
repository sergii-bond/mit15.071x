Google Trends
Google Search Queries - Google Trends allows public retrieval of weekly counts
for every query searched by users around the world. For each location, the
counts are normalized by dividing the count for each query in a particular week
by the total number of online search queries submitted in that location during
the week. Then, the values are adjusted to be between 0 and 1.
