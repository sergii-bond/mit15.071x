PUBMED
The dataset consists of the titles (variable title) and abstracts (variable
abstract) of papers retrieved in a Pubmed search. Each search result is labeled
with whether the paper is a clinical trial testing a drug therapy for cancer
(variable trial). These labels were obtained by two people reviewing each
search result and accessing the actual paper if necessary, as part of a
literature review of clinical trials testing drug therapies for advanced and
metastatic breast cancer.

In this homework problem, we will build and evaluate a spam filter using a
publicly available dataset first described in the 2006 conference paper "Spam
Filtering with Naive Bayes -- Which Naive Bayes?" by V. Metsis, I.
Androutsopoulos, and G. Paliouras. The "ham" messages in this dataset come from
the inbox of former Enron Managing Director for Research Vincent Kaminski, one
of the inboxes in the Enron Corpus. One source of spam messages in this dataset
is the SpamAssassin corpus, which contains hand-labeled spam messages
contributed by Internet users. The remaining spam was collected by Project
Honey Pot, a project that collects spam messages and identifies spammers by
publishing email address that humans would know not to contact but that bots
might target with spam. The full dataset we will use was constructed as roughly
a 75/25 mix of the ham and spam messages.

The dataset contains just two fields:

    text: The text of the email.
        spam: A binary variable indicating if the email was spam.
